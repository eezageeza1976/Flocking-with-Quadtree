# Flocking-with-Quadtree
Flocking using a quadtree algorithm

Flocking simulation using a quadtree to reduce the amount of processing required for each 'Boid' object.

When running press 'o' to switch on the quadtree quadrants to watch it working.

Use the mouse button to place obsticles. Very basic obsticle avoidance.
